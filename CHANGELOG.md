## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- OpenAI-compatible MLX gateway (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/completions`, `/v1/models`, `/health`)
  with model routing/aliasing, lazy model swapping, bearer auth, audit logging, output
  sanitization, and per-model max-token clamping.
- nginx loopback reverse proxy with long-inference timeouts.
- Operational scripts (start/stop/status/benchmark/validate) and agent wrappers.
- Production project layout: `src/` package, `tests/`, `deploy/`, `docs/`, CI, and packaging.

### Changed
- Restructured from a flat working tree into a `src/`-layout package.
- Gateway log directory and nginx paths are now relative/derived (no hardcoded user paths).
