# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- **Governance plane (policy-as-code).** Externalized policy (`config/policy.toml`, TOML via
  stdlib `tomllib`) defining principals (API-key identities). Keys are stored as SHA-256
  hashes, never plaintext.
- **Identity + authorization.** Each request is resolved to a principal; the requested model
  alias is authorized against that principal's allowlist (403 on denial), and the effective
  output-token cap is the tightest of request / per-model / per-principal limits.
- **Structured decision audit** (`logs/decisions.jsonl`): one JSON record per authorization
  decision (request_id, principal, model, allow/deny, reason, status) for SIEM ingestion.
- Tests for the policy layer and authz paths (suite 4 → 17).

### Changed
- Gateway now launches as a module (`python -m private_ai_gateway.app`) for clean
  intra-package imports; start/stop scripts updated accordingly.
- Single static token mode is preserved as an "owner" break-glass principal when no policy
  file is present (zero-config local development).

### Security
- Fail-closed auth (refuses to start without `PRIVATE_AI_AUTH_TOKEN`), constant-time bearer
  comparison, Authorization header no longer logged, and a request-body size limit
  (`MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`).

### Tooling
- CI split into a lint/scan job (ruff, Bandit SAST, pip-audit dependency CVE scan, shellcheck)
  and a test+coverage job on Apple-Silicon runners (so MLX tests actually execute).
- CodeQL security analysis workflow; coverage gate (`make cov`), `make sast`, `make audit`,
  and `make check`; README CI/CodeQL/Python/License badges.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- OpenAI-compatible MLX gateway (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/completions`, `/v1/models`, `/health`)
  with model routing/aliasing, lazy model swapping, bearer auth, audit logging, output
  sanitization, and per-model max-token clamping.
- nginx loopback reverse proxy with long-inference timeouts.
- Operational scripts (start/stop/status/benchmark/validate) and agent wrappers.
- Production project layout: `src/` package, `tests/`, `deploy/`, `docs/`, CI, and packaging.

### Changed
- Restructured from a flat working tree into a `src/`-layout package.
- Gateway log directory and nginx paths are now relative/derived (no hardcoded user paths).
