> ## AI capability is not AI authority.
>
> A **local-first AI governance plane** for Apple Silicon (MLX): an OpenAI-compatible
> gateway that mediates every call to a local model — **policy-as-code identity, model
> authorization, an enforced L0–L6 autonomy ceiling, egress guardrails, and a structured
> decision audit**, behind an nginx loopback boundary.
>
> A leaked low-privilege key can't reach a model it was never granted; an agent capped at
> *suggest* can't be handed work that *executes*. Enforced in code, **before any model
> loads** — not asserted in a README — with every allow/deny recorded and independently
> re-verified.

## How it enforces

Every request crosses the loopback boundary and runs a fixed gauntlet of checks. Each
gate fails **closed** with a specific status, and every outcome — allow or deny — is
written to the decision audit and the metrics counters.

```

Note the ordering: **authz, autonomy, and rate-limit denials all happen *before* the
model loads** — an unauthorized or runaway request is rejected cheaply, never paying for
inference it wasn't allowed to run.

## Proven, not asserted

The differentiator isn't that these controls exist — it's that they are **attacked** by
an adversarial eval suite that fails CI on regression, and **independently re-verified**
by a read-only assurance agent (OpenClaw) that reconciles the audit, metrics, and policy.
Each row is a control, the attack against it, and where that attack is proven to fail:

| Control | Attack it repels | Enforced in | Proven by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fail-closed auth | unauthenticated / wrong token | `app.py` (constant-time) | `evals` AUTHN-001/002 · `test_auth` |
| Identity + model authz | low-priv key reaches an ungranted model | `policy.py` → `403` | `evals` AUTHZ-001 · `test_policy` |
| **Autonomy ceiling** | agent declares more autonomy than its mandate | `autonomy.py` → `403` | `evals` AUTONOMY-001/002 · `test_autonomy` |
| Autonomy **under-declare** | low level in header, high in body | `declared_level` (most-privileged-wins) | `evals` **AUTONOMY-004** — the real bug it caught |
| Rate limiting | one key saturates the gateway | `ratelimit.py` → `429` | `evals` RATELIMIT-001 · `test_ratelimit` |
| Secret egress | model surfaces an AWS key / JWT / PEM | `guardrails.py` redact/block | `evals` EGRESS-001…004 · `test_guardrails` |
| **Captured-model bound** | injection / context-poisoning hijacks the model itself | authority decided **off the prompt path** | `evals` **AGENTIC-001/002/003** — OWASP Agentic ASI01/03/06 |
| **A2A delegation** | an agent is handed a skill / autonomy beyond its mandate | `/a2a/tasks` → `403` skill_not_allowed / autonomy_exceeded | `evals` **A2A-001/002** — OWASP Agentic ASI03/07 |
| **MCP tool access** | a principal invokes an ungranted or over-privileged tool | `/mcp/call` → `403` tool_not_allowed / autonomy_exceeded | `evals` **MCP-001** — OWASP Agentic ASI02 |
| Apply integrity | an apply runs ungated or escapes its sandbox | `opencode_sandbox/apply.py` | OpenClaw `AC-APPLY-INTEGRITY` · `test_opencode_act` |

→ Run the attacks yourself: `make evals` · Re-verify the controls: `make` + see [docs/threat-model.md](docs/threat-model.md).

## Orchestration control plane

The gateway is the enforcement substrate for a three-component agent control plane. Each
component authenticates as its **own principal** with its own model allowlist and autonomy
ceiling — there is no shared "god" identity. They form a closed **plan → act → verify →
record** loop where a model may *reason* about anything, but what *executes* is decided
and recorded by the governance plane.

## See it enforce (no GIF)

With a policy active, the `hermes` token resolves to a principal capped at **L1 (suggest),
models `["strategy"]`**. Every attempt to exceed that mandate is refused on the wire,
before any model loads:

```console
$ curl -s -XPOST :8081/v1/chat/completions -H "Authorization: Bearer $HERMES" \
       -H "X-Autonomy-Level: 6" -d '{"model":"strategy","messages":[...]}'
{"error":{"code":"autonomy_exceeded","message":"Principal 'hermes' is capped at
 autonomy L1 (suggest); request declared L6 (unbounded)","type":"permission_error"}}
HTTP 403

$ curl ... -d '{"model":"offsec","messages":[...]}'          # not in its allowlist
{"error":{"code":"model_not_allowed","message":"Principal 'hermes' is not permitted
 to use model 'offsec'","type":"permission_error"}}
HTTP 403

$ curl ... -H "X-Autonomy-Level: 1" -d '{"autonomy_level":6,...}'   # under-declare
{"error":{"code":"autonomy_exceeded", ...}}    # most-privileged-wins: still 403
HTTP 403
```

The denials land in `logs/decisions.jsonl` and `/metrics`; OpenClaw then reconciles them
(`AC-AUTONOMY-CEILING` / `AC-AUTHZ-MODEL` → PASS). That's the whole thesis, observable on
`127.0.0.1`. Reproduce it: [docs/runbook.md](docs/runbook.md#live-enforcement-demo).

## Quickstart

**Install and run (loopback, no nginx):**

```bash
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install .                      # Apple Silicon / MLX; installs the console command
export PRIVATE_AI_AUTH_TOKEN=...    # fail-closed: required to serve
private-ai-gateway serve            # Flask on 127.0.0.1:8080
```

**Or the hardened loopback stack (Flask behind the nginx boundary):**

```bash
make install && cp .env.example .env && make start && make status

curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8081/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PRIVATE_AI_AUTH_TOKEN" | python3 -m json.tool

make stop
```

With no policy file the gateway runs single-principal (owner, all models) so local dev is
zero-config. Drop in `config/policy.toml` to enable the per-principal ceilings shown above.

### Governed agentic surfaces (A2A + MCP)

The same plane that gates inference also gates **agent-to-agent delegation** and **tool
calls** — capability is not authority on any surface:

```console
$ curl :8080/.well-known/agent-card.json -H "$H"     # A2A discovery: skills + autonomy ceiling (from policy)
$ curl :8080/a2a/tasks  -H "$H" -d '{"skill":"deploy.prod"}'        # 403 skill_not_allowed
$ curl :8080/mcp/call   -H "$H" -d '{"tool":"shell.exec"}'         # 403 tool_not_allowed
$ curl :8080/mcp/call   -H "$H" -d '{"tool":"clock.now"}'          # 200 — granted + within autonomy
```

## Status & limitations (honest)

- Gateway is **text-compatible, not tool-execution-compatible** — by design; it refuses to fake tool calls.
- Autonomy/egress gating is **opt-in via policy**; with no policy file the owner token is all-models break-glass.
- Guardrails are high-precision **regex denylists** (defense-in-depth, not exhaustive recall).
- API keys are **static** (no rotation/expiry yet); rate limiting is **in-process, per-node**.
- **No TLS** — loopback use only. **MLX is Apple-Silicon only.**
