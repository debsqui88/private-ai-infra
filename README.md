# Private AI Gateway

A **local-first AI governance plane** for Apple Silicon (MLX): an OpenAI-compatible gateway that
mediates access to local models with **policy-as-code identity, authorization, output guardrails,
and a structured decision audit** — behind an nginx loopback boundary.

The thesis is that **AI capability should not automatically become AI authority**. The value
isn't that a model runs locally — it's the enforceable control boundary around it: who may call
which model, under what limits, with every allow/deny decision recorded.

## Architecture

```text
client (OpenAI SDK / agent CLI)         Authorization: Bearer <api-key>
  ▼
nginx loopback proxy        127.0.0.1:8081   deploy/nginx/nginx.conf
  ▼
Flask gateway + governance  127.0.0.1:8080   src/private_ai_gateway/
  • identity + authorization (policy.py)   • decision audit (audit.py)
  ▼
MLX inference → local model  Apple Silicon   mlx-community/*
```

Requests route by a stable **alias** so clients never hardcode model names:

| alias | model |
|-------|-------|
| `strategy` | `mlx-community/Qwen3.6-27B-OptiQ-4bit` |
| `engineering` | `mlx-community/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-8bit` |
| `offsec` | `mlx-community/Llama-3-70B-Instruct-Gradient-1048k-4bit` |

The gateway lazily swaps models on demand (clearing the MLX cache between loads), strips visible
thinking/tool-call/control markers from output, refuses to fake tool execution, and clamps
output tokens per model.

## Governance

Authorization is **policy-as-code**. A TOML policy file defines principals (API-key
identities); keys are stored as **SHA-256 hashes**, never plaintext:

```toml
# config/policy.toml  (gitignored; copy from config/policy.example.toml)
[[principals]]
name = "analyst"
key_sha256 = "…"          # printf '%s' 'the-key' | shasum -a 256
allowed_models = ["strategy", "engineering"]
max_output_tokens = 2048
```

- **Identity** — the bearer token is hashed and resolved to a principal.
- **Authorization** — a model outside the principal's `allowed_models` returns `403`; the
  effective token cap is the tightest of request / per-model / per-principal.
- **Decision audit** — every allow/deny is appended to `logs/decisions.jsonl` (request id,
  principal, model, reason) for SIEM ingestion.

With no policy file, the gateway runs single-principal using `PRIVATE_AI_AUTH_TOKEN` (an owner
identity allowed every model), so local development stays zero-config.

## Quickstart

```bash
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
make install                       # runtime deps (Apple Silicon / MLX)
cp .env.example .env               # set PRIVATE_AI_AUTH_TOKEN
make start                         # launch Flask + nginx
make status

curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8081/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PRIVATE_AI_AUTH_TOKEN" | python3 -m json.tool

make stop
```

## Project layout

```text
src/private_ai_gateway/   # gateway (app.py) + governance (policy.py, audit.py)
config/                   # policy.example.toml — governance policy-as-code
deploy/nginx/             # nginx loopback reverse-proxy config
scripts/                  # operational entrypoints (start/stop/status/benchmark)
agents/                   # owner-run operator wrappers (least-privilege, monitoring/inspection)
tests/                    # unit/ (pytest) + integration/ (stack smoke test)
docs/                     # architecture, security model, runbook, roadmap
```

## Security

Fail-closed bearer auth (constant-time), policy-as-code identity & authorization, output
sanitization, per-principal token caps, request-size limits, loopback-only binding, and a
structured decision audit. Tool execution is intentionally **not** trusted. See
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and [docs/security-model.md](docs/security-model.md).

## Development

```bash
make install-dev
make lint        # ruff
make test        # pytest (MLX-dependent tests auto-skip off Apple Silicon)
```

## Status & limitations

- Gateway is text-compatible, not real tool-execution-compatible (by design).
- TLS is planned, not active; the gateway is intended for loopback use.
- MLX is Apple-Silicon only.
