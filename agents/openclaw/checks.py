"""Assurance controls: pure functions over evidence that each return one Finding.

A control answers a single question about whether a governance control held, using the
evidence OpenClaw was given. The rules across all controls:

  - **PASS**         — there is evidence the control held and none that it failed.
  - **FAIL**         — there is evidence the control was violated, or an integrity
                       problem (e.g. a malformed audit record).
  - **INCONCLUSIVE** — there is no evidence either way (e.g. the control was never
                       exercised, or the source needed to judge it was not supplied).

Every control is a plain function of an ``Evidence`` bundle, so each is trivially unit
testable without a running gateway.
