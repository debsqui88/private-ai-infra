"""Core eval types and runner.

An ``EvalCase`` is one adversarial probe: it ``run``s against a ``Context`` (the gateway
transport and/or the egress guardrail) and ``check``s that the control held. A control
*holding* is a **PASS**; a control that let the attack through is a **FAIL**. A case that
cannot run in this environment (e.g. a gateway probe with no gateway available) is
**SKIP** — never silently passed.

The harness is transport-agnostic on purpose: the real run drives the live gateway via a
Flask test client, but the harness logic is exercised in CI with a fake transport, so the
attack catalogue and the scoring are validated without needing MLX.
